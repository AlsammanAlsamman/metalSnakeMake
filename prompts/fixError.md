DO NOT WRITE ANY CODE or file contents until I type exactly: start code.
First ask at least 5 yes/no questions (use answers only yes/no). Some must be tailored to the reported error/requirements.
Show a one-line summary of your understanding.
Propose 2–3 concise fix/options (one recommended, one-line reason).
List files you would change (filenames only) and a brief before-coding checklist.
Wait for my yes/no answers and the exact phrase start code before coding.
After coding, keep responses minimal (one-line description + changed files/contents).
